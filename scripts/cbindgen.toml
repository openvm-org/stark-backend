# cbindgen configuration for the Rust/CUDA ABI matcher pipeline.
# Run from crates/cuda-backend:  cbindgen -c ../../scripts/cbindgen.toml . -o rust_abi.hpp
#
# When adding a new SDK config module gated by #[cfg(feature = "...")]:
#   1. Add a "feature = <name>" = "<CPP_DEFINE>" entry under [defines] below.
#   2. Update scripts/gen_stub.py with fallback type definitions for the new
#      config (F, EF, Digest) if they differ from the default.
#   3. Test locally — see gen_stub.py docstring for the full command sequence.
