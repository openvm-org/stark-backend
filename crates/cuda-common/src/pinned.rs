//! Page-locked (pinned) host-buffer pool for staging host-to-device copies.
//!
//! Intended for large host buffers that are allocated fresh for every round
//! of work (e.g. per proving segment), partially written, copied to the
//! device, and dropped. Copies from pageable memory run at a fraction of
//! PCIe bandwidth, but page-locking a buffer is itself expensive (~1-2 GB/s),
//! and buffers are often provisioned at full capacity while only partially
//! written, so neither registration nor re-zeroing may sit on the caller's
//! critical path. Dropped buffers are therefore handed via [`give_back`] to a
//! background cleaner thread which registers them once (`cudaHostRegister`),
//! zeroes the prefix the previous owner wrote, and only then returns them to
//! the pool. [`take`] hands out ready (registered, all-zero) buffers on a
//! pool hit; on a miss it falls back to a fresh pageable allocation — exactly
//! the no-pool behavior — so the worst case (no CUDA device, cleaner not yet
//! caught up) matches the status quo. Capacities are rounded up to the next
//! power of two so recurring buffers of varying sizes share pool entries.
//!
//! Lifetime hazard: `cudaMemcpyAsync` from *pageable* memory returns only
//! after the source has been staged, so code not using the pool may free a
//! source buffer right after enqueueing its copy. From *pinned* memory the
//! call returns immediately with the DMA still in flight, so a returned
//! buffer must not be zeroed or reused until previously enqueued work has
//! drained. The cleaner therefore calls `cudaDeviceSynchronize` (batched over
//! every buffer waiting in its queue) before touching buffer contents.
